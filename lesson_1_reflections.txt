Sarah's Version Control Lesson 1 Reflections

1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug?

error fast. 
It also helps to compare and look for mistakes in code which otherwise aren't
error but effective the working of code somehow.

Now i have a situation where branch merging will raise a conflict.
